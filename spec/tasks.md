**Parallel Streams:**

* Backend core (Tasks 1–4,14) can proceed in parallel with Frontend scaffold (Task 15).
* CRUD APIs (Tasks 5–7) feed into both Execution Engine (Tasks 8–12) and UI components (Tasks 16–19).
* Testing & Docs (Tasks 20–21) span all completed feature areas.

*Ready for review before sprint planning.*
