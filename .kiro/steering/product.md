# Product Overview

**Runbook Studio** is a web-based application designed for SRE engineers, on-call engineers, and developers to author, manage, and execute operational runbooks. The application streamlines incident containment and reduces MTTR by providing:

- Interactive runbook creation with multiple block types (instructions, commands, API calls, conditionals, timers)
- Real-time execution engine with inline output display (similar to Jupyter notebooks)
- Secure credential management with encryption
- Role-based access control (RBAC)
- Versioning and rollback capabilities
- Comprehensive audit logging and execution history

## Key Use Cases

- **Incident Response**: Step-by-step runbooks for containing and resolving incidents
- **Operational Maintenance**: Automated routine tasks and deployments
- **Knowledge Sharing**: Centralized, executable documentation for operational procedures
- **Compliance**: Audit trails for all runbook executions and modifications

## Target Users

- Site Reliability Engineers (SREs)
- On-call Engineers
- Developers
- Operations Managers
